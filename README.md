### Elevation and terrain mapping for Robotics:
The elevation mapping technique which was introduced in 2005 during the DARPA challenge by [[Researchers at Stanford University](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rob.20147)] was proposed for easier representation of point clouds for ground segementation and real-time autonomous driving. Although, some of the above indicated in literature the use of an elevation method [[RECM-JCP](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/16/3239/xml)], a review of thier code shows the use of the polar grid mapping method which is also a very popular and efficient technique for point cloud representation. This section would also include elevation and terrain mapping applied to **SLAM and robotic navigation**.
